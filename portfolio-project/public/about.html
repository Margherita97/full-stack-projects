<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I'm Margherita, I come from Italy, but I've been living in Zagreb, Croatia, for already 4 years!</p>

<p>It's not my first time learning html and css, but since I had to take a break I decided to go back and revise some concepts.
  My plan is to continue and learn JavaScript too.</p>

<p>I hope you'll enjoy my portfolio!</p>
